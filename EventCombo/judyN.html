    <span style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: 16px;">At RockIT Women’s very first Networking Luncheon featuring Judy
        Nichols, Dean Dorton, will&nbsp; be held at&nbsp; University - Harry Frazier Hall, West Brandeis Avenue,
        Louisville she will share insights into cracking the “data code”. In her own words, “Transformation can feel
        like an overwhelming task, but when you break it down and understand the components, it becomes achievable. This
        isn’t something just for giant corporations – every organization can benefit from thinking through their data
        approach.” As a Microsoft Gold Partner, Judy has learned firsthand how to demystify this approach, and will help
        you understand that anyone can transform her/his business using data</span><br></div>

        Though many don’t realize it, we are already seeing the results of data analysis in social media and marketing.
        The potential for positive change in public health and many other areas is powerful, and as we move further
        along in this spectrum, it becomes a game changer for the small business owner to compete against big players.
        Indeed, it is possible to take all of your collected data, and use it to create a predictive model for your
        business. With Judy’s experience and in-depth knowledge, you can finally break out of this data chrysalis,
        spread your butterfly wings and fly high!

        Judy Nichols started her career working in all aspects of physician practices for several years including
        Cardiovascular Testing, Lab, Transcription, Coding, Billing, AR/AP, Physician Recruitment, and Practice
        Management. She helped found the Toledo Medic Users Group in 1991, aided several practices in starting the
        process toward electronic medical records, and worked as a consultant with a hospital reimbursement specialty
        organization before getting her Bachelor’s degree at the University of Louisville in Computer Information
        Systems. </p>
    <font face="Georgia"><span id="dot"></span></font><span id="readMore" style="display: none;">
        <p>
            She joined Aspect Software (then Quilogy) in 2006 as a Managing Consultant and ended as a Senior Director in
            their Professional Services Division leading their Services Healthcare Vertical and Collaboration Practice.
            In this role she was responsible for delivering solutions that enabled Aspect’s customers to more fully
            engage within the enterprise and to their consumer base. She was also a leader in the Aspect Women in
            Technology group.
        </p>
        <p>In September of 2016 Judy, along with her partners Greg Petrites and Jessica Gray, launched a new company
            called Breakpoint Technology. Their vision was to build on their long standing commitment to customer
            relationships and to drive improvements within the enterprise through collaborative and innovative
            partnerships with the customer that focused on understanding the business needs first and foremost.</p>

        <p>Using the concept of a "breakpoint" or an intentional pause or rest point in which the programmer solves
            problems and find solutions, the company steps through business issues to help customers find the best
            approach in which to move forward rather than forcing them into a one size fits all scenario.
        </p>
        <p>Judy is also a member of the Jefferson County 4H Council, a Board Member for the Kentucky Foundation for
            Women, 4H Leader for the Kids &amp; K9s 4H Club, and an active Mission Volunteer through Watkins United
            Methodist Church. She has previously been an active volunteer for Jefferson County Public Schools, Eastern
            High School Soccer, Eastern High School Choir, and the YMCA sports program.
