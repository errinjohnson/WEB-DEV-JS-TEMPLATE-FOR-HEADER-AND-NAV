       <h4>Boosting Your Software Team's Productivity:</h4>
       <h4>The SPACE Framework in Action</h4>

       <p>Measuring the productivity of engineering teams is challenging, and traditional DevOps metrics only focus on
         technical outcomes. Metrics like deployment frequency and mean time to restore a service are easy to measure
         but fail to provide a complete view of team performance, including factors like motivation and communication
         effectiveness. Engineering is a collaborative process that requires consideration of human and emotional
         aspects.</p>
       <p>To address this, the creators of the DORA metrics developed the SPACE framework, which consists of
         five dimensions: Satisfaction & well-being, Performance, Activity, Communication & collaboration, and
         Efficiency & flow. The SPACE framework offers a more holistic approach to measuring developer productivity.
