    <h3 style="text-align: center">Meet Alicia</h3>
    <p>"Alicia is an experienced educator, with a strong passion for Ed Tech, STEM and empowering young girls to
        explore the possibilities of working with technology.
        As National Outreach Manager for TechGirlz she works with volunteers and other organizations to help them
        bring the free technology based workshops
        (or TechShopz in a BoxTM, as they’ve coined them) to new communities across the U.S. She also manages the
        website blog, where you can check out the
        latest news on TechGirlz or read about their volunteers’ experiences with the organization!"

            "LoAlicia’s always enjoyed self learning new technologies and instilling them into her lessons, but knew
            she was destined for something more outside of the classroom.
            In October 2015, Alicia attended a meetup in Philly hosted by TechGirlz and immediately felt a strong
            connection towards the mission.
            Soon after, she began to use her skills to help update and build curriculum for the org, coordinate the
            blog, and more.<br>

            Alicia spends her downtime running races with her husband, walking her dog, Dottie, by the river or
            relaxing down the shore in North Wildwood.
            She’s obsessed with organization, music, finding the best memes to communicate with, and taking photos
            of the world around her (which end up being mostly of her dog). <br>

            “One of my favorite quotes states ‘Empowered Women, Empower Women’ but I think empowered girls make an
            even bigger impact!
