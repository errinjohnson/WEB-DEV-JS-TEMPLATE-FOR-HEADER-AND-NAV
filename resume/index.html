                <h4>Professional Summary</h4>
                <p>
                    <p>I have been a “Just in Time”(JiT) learner, looking for a solution when needed. In my jobs, I
                        was looking for ways to smooth the processes of the job, timely follow up with customers, create
                        simple a file system that gave means to an end. My best successes was when their was
                        <b>collaboration</b> with my peers. I believe in good <b>communication</b>, simple
                        <b>consideration</b>s and the ability to give someones'
                        idea an opportunity to succeed, <b>cooperation</b>.</p>
                    <h4>Career Interests</h4>
                    <p>I would like to be part of a team that can troubleshoot problems when a solution , that has a few
                        bugs , can be resolved. If we can find the underlying cause of why there is a problem , we have
                        a realistic opportunity to succeed. I would like to be part of collaboration, communication,
                        consideration and cooperation. Any company and or job that has these soft skills, are already
                        thriving in doing something they enjoy. </p>
                    <p>After reading a dissertation, about soft skills, the growing gap, I found the last
                        piece of the puzzle, "Who Am I"</p>
                    <q> <a href="#footnote"> [1] </a>In fact, the results from semi-constructive 189
                        interviews demonstrate that 93 percent of all interviewed employers rank
                        the <b>soft skills</b> related to leadership as the single most essential
                        skills to master in the future of healthcare and STEM. <b>-Haleh Karimi</b></q>

                            Encourage students to think out their projects with a wire frame, keeping it simple and you
                            can build it up from there, if they chose to do so. I focus on mobile first and CSS Grid and
                            Flexbox layouts techniques. I like setting the Javascript foundation at its' basics, with
                            small snippets on a form. I encourage students not to copy and paste code snippets from
                            googling the search engines, but to learn why validation is important and how the logic
                            flows. </p>

                            have that personal engagement with the student, it help <b>communicate</b> and filter thru
                            to find the underlying issue, that was preventing a student from moving forward. I noticed
                            students were not comprehending the assignments, they didn't know what a particular
                            assignment was asking them to complete. I understood where they were coming from, being a
                            recent graduate at the school. Some students just need more time, to be engaged with the
                            assignment, and to clarify any misunderstanding.

                        <p> Main responsibility was to create a database for the KCTC Nursing
                            Department. I was a student at the time, and the database project would take the place of
                            class credits . I collaborated with an Assistant Professor within the Nursing Department
                            to create a Nursing Evaluation Tool(NET). There was a need to have the students' clinical
                            reports and evaluations dynamically imputed into a database; faculty, in a timely and
                            efficient manner could then evaluate, give student feedback and create reports required by
                            the state. At that time everything was on paper , in a file cabinet, and to be sorted and
                            organized to start creating reports. </p>
                        <p> There were many challenges but one stood out, breakdown in <b>communication</b> between the
                            departments. After completion of the NET, we couldn't put the database on the school network
                            because of security and HIPPA violation. I learned that communication and cooperation have a
                            powerful <b>reslove</b> capacity. Next time I will start with that!
