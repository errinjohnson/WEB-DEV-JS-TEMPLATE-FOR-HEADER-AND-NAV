                <h5>Professional Summary</h5>
                <p>
                    <p>I have been a “Just in Time”(JiT) learner, looking for a solution when needed. I have also been
                        passionate about technology hardware and software. It wasnt until recently, that I changed my
                        career focus. I love to code, create databases. I started out taking apart computers to see
                        how they work and watch DIY programs to learn what I needed at that time, such as, replace
                        a screen on a tablet, or iphone.
                        <p>I created three <b>databases </b>for companies, trained employees, users, of the databases,
                            and communicated with IT department to add the database to a companies network, to maintain
                            and to update. My best successes was when their was <b>collaboration</b> with my peers.</p>
                        <h5>Career Interests</h5>
                        <p>I believe in good <b>communication</b>, simple
                            <b>consideration</b>s and the ability to give someone’s
                            idea an opportunity to succeed, <b>cooperation</b>.</p>
                        <p>I am seeking a company that can harness these soft skills into technical hard skills.  I
                            would like an opportunity to work in coding a software application or database, and UX.
                            I am intermediate to advance with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I enjoy learning Python, took a
                            couple courses
                            but wanted to master one language first, but I have experience C# and Python, in
                            school and self taught interests or curiosity. I feel I could easily adapt to a new coding
                            language because I have a very good understanding of the Software Development Cycle, and
                            more importantly good logic and design aptitudes.

                            Encourage students to think out their projects with a wire frame, keeping it simple and you

                            small snippets on a form. I encourage students not to copy and paste code snippets from
                            googling the search engines, but to learn why validation is important and how the logic
