                <h5>Professional Summary</h5>
                <p>
                    <p><a href="#footnote2"> [2]</a> I have been a “Just in Time”(JiT) learner, looking for a solution
                        when needed. I have been passionate about technology hardware and software. It wasn't until
                        recently, that I changed my career focus. I love to code, create databases. I started out taking
                        apart computers to see how they work and watch DIY programs to learn what I needed at that time,
                        such as, replace a screen on a tablet, or iPhone.
                    </p>
                    <p>I created three databases for companies, trained their employees, users of the databases, and
                        communicated with their IT department to add the database to a companies network, to maintain
                        and to update. My best successes was when their was collaboration with my peers. I believe in
                        good communication, simple considerations and the ability to give someone’s idea an opportunity
                        to succeed, cooperation.</p>

                    <p>I believe in good <b>communication</b>, simple <b>consideration</b>s and the ability to give
                        someone’s idea an opportunity to succeed, <b>cooperation</b>.</p>
                    <p> am intermediate to advance with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I feel I could easily adapt to a new
                        coding language because I have a very good understanding of the software development cycle and
                        computer logic.

                            students were not comprehending the assignments; they didn't know what a particular

                            was the creation of a <em>file index </em><b>database </b>for the Rates and Regulator
                            department. I <b>collaborated</b> with employees, users of the database, to create a
                            user-friendly system that used their departments verbiage and file indexing. The employees
                            and I physical created labeling for file cabinets and folders and filed accordingly. I
                            trained users on the new file index database and communicated with LG&amp;E IT department to
                            map database to company’s' department network, maintain and backup data. Other departments:
                            Scheduled meetings with Outlook and set up conference calls, receptionist duties.
                            Customer service with Call Center department.

                            months, the company saw my technical skills, and hired me for contractual work, to set up
                            the new ESC software systems. I took initiative for the project when I realized I understood
                            the foundation of data conversion and systems, and I knew I could contact ESC staff for
                            support to help me walk thru some of the set up. I understood technical jargon and I asked
                            to set up the system.</p>
