                <p data-text="database"><a href="#footnote2"> [2]</a> I am a “Just in Time”(JiT) learner who researches
                    solutions. I love
                    to code and create databases. I am naturally investigative, I started out taking apart computers
                    to see how they work and watching DIY programs to learn what I needed at that time, such as
                    replacing a screen on a tablet, or iPhone.
                </p>
                <p data-text="database">I learned MS Access to create a simple database so I could do my job better, I
                    went on to create
                    another database for the same company, trained their employees, users of the databases, and
                    communicated with their IT department to add the database to a company’s network, to maintain
                    and to update. My best success was when there was a collaboration with my peers. I believe in
                    good communication, simple considerations, and the ability to allow someone’s idea to succeed,
                    cooperation.
